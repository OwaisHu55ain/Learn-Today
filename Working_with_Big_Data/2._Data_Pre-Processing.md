# Data Pre-Processing in Python: Wrangling Your Raw Data to Insights

Data pre-processing, also known as data cleaning or wrangling, is the crucial first step in transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis. This process involves various techniques to ensure your data is complete, consistent, and ready for meaningful insights.

## Dealing with Missing Values: Finding the Gaps

Missing values, often represented by empty cells, "?", or "N/A", can pose a challenge in data analysis. Here are some approaches to handle them:

1. **Consult the Data Source:** If possible, reach out to the source of your data to understand the reasoning behind missing values. This can help you decide on the best course of action.
2. **Drop Missing Values:** You can choose to remove either the entire row or column containing missing values. However, be cautious of losing valuable information, especially if the missing values are few.
3. **Replace Missing Values:** This method involves imputing missing values with alternative approaches:
    - **Average:** Replace missing values with the average of similar data points.
    - **Frequency:** Substitute them with the most frequent value in the column.
    - **Function-based:** Employ advanced techniques like statistical modeling to estimate missing values based on relationships within the data.
4. **Leave as Missing:** In some cases, leaving missing values intact might be preferable, especially if their presence reveals valuable information about the data collection process.

The best approach depends on the context of your data and analysis goals.

## Data Formatting: Standardizing for Clarity

Data often originates from diverse sources, leading to inconsistencies in format. Bringing your data into a common format enhances clarity and simplifies calculations:

- **Non-formatted data:** Confusing, difficult to aggregate and compare.
- **Formatted data:** Clearer, easier to analyze and compare.

Converting units, ensuring consistent data types, and applying formatting to numerical values are key steps in this process.

## Applying Calculations: Transforming for Analysis

Sometimes, you might need to transform entire columns to suit your analysis. For example, converting miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) in a car dataset involves applying calculations across the entire column. Pandas provides convenient methods like `df["mpg"] = 235/df["mpg"]` to achieve this efficiently.

## Correcting Data Types: Setting the Stage

Data can sometimes be assigned the wrong data type, like storing numerical values as text. Pandas allows you to identify and rectify data types using methods like `df.dtypes()`. Converting data types, such as changing "Age" from text to integer format using `df["Age"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Age"])`, ensures accurate calculations and analysis.

## Mastering Indexing: Locating Your Data Precisely

Pandas offers two primary indexing methods:

1. **loc (Label-based Indexing):** Select data based on labels (row and column names). Example: `df.loc[0, 'Name']` retrieves the first row's "Name" value.
2. **iloc (Integer-location based Indexing):** Select data based on integer positions. Example: `df.iloc[0, 0]` retrieves the value at the first row and first column.

Understanding these methods empowers you to access and manipulate specific data points effectively.

By mastering these data pre-processing techniques, you equip your raw data with the clarity and structure needed to unlock valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.

```python

import pandas as pd

 # Sample data with missing values
data = {
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", None, "David"],
    "Age": [25, 30, None, 40],
    "City": ["New York", "Los Angeles", None, "Houston"]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

 # Drop rows with missing values (axis=0) or columns (axis=1)
df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)  # Drop rows with missing values

 # Replace missing values with mean (average)
df["Age"].fillna(df["Age"].mean(), inplace=True)  # Replace missing Age with mean

 # Replace missing values with custom value
df["City"].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)  # Replace missing City with "Unknown"

print(df)
```
