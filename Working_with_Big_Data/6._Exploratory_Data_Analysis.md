## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is like taking a first dive into a pool of data. It's the initial stage of analyzing and understanding a dataset before diving deeper into complex models or hypothesis testing. Here's what it involves:

### Goals:

**Describe the data:** Summarize key characteristics like central tendencies, variability, and presence of outliers.

**Identify patterns and trends:** Observe relationships between variables and discover interesting aspects of the data.

**Check for assumptions:** Ensure the data meets the requirements for further analysis methods.

**Formulate hypotheses:** Generate initial ideas about what the data might reveal.

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the collection, organization, summarization, and presentation of data. Its primary goal is to describe and summarize features of a dataset through numerical calculations, graphs, or tables. 

## Common techniques and measures in descriptive statistics include:

## 1. Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, mode

### Mean:
* The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a data set and dividing the sum by the total number of values.
* It is often referred to as the average.
* Formula: Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

### Median:

* The median is the middle value of a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.
* If the data set has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.
* If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### Mode:

* The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.
* A data set can have one mode, more than one mode (multi-modal), or no mode (when no value is repeated).
* It is possible for a data set to have more than one mode if multiple values appear with the same highest frequency.


## 2. Measures of Variability/Dispersion: 
"Measure of Dispersion" and "Measure of Variability" are interchangeable terms in statistics, representing how data points spread from the central value. They aid in understanding data distribution, assessing reliability, controlling variability, comparing datasets, and supporting statistical analyses like correlation, hypothesis testing, and regression.

### Properties of a Good Measure of Dispersion:
* Simple to understand
* Easy to calculate
* Rigidly defined
* Based on each and every item of the distribution
* Responsive to further algebraic treatment
* Demonstrates sampling stability
* It should not be unduly affected by extreme items.

1. **Range:**
   - The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.
   - Formula: Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value
   - It provides a quick and easy way to understand the spread of data but can be sensitive to outliers.

2. **Variance:**
   - Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset.
   - Formula: Variance (σ²) = Σ((x - μ)²) / N
     - Where Σ represents summation, x is each individual data point, μ is the mean of the dataset, and N is the total number of data points.
   - It quantifies the spread of data points around the mean. A higher variance indicates greater dispersion.

3. **Standard Deviation:**
   - Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average deviation of data points from the mean.
   - Formula: Standard Deviation (σ) = √Variance
   - It is often preferred over variance as it is in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable.
   - Standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean, with higher values indicating greater variability.



## 3. Measures of distribution shape: Skewness, kurtosis

1. **Skewness:**
   - Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.
   - It quantifies the degree to which a distribution differs from a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve (such as the normal distribution).
   - Skewness can be positive, negative, or zero.
     - Positive skewness indicates that the distribution has a longer or fatter tail on the right side. The mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left side, and there are relatively few higher values.
     - Negative skewness indicates that the distribution has a longer or fatter tail on the left side. The mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right side, and there are relatively few lower values.
     - A skewness of zero indicates a perfectly symmetrical distribution.

2. **Kurtosis:**
   - Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" or peakedness of a probability distribution.
   - It describes the shape of the distribution's tails relative to its peak.
   - Kurtosis can be positive, negative, or zero.
     - Positive kurtosis (or leptokurtic) indicates that the distribution has heavier tails and a sharper peak than the normal distribution.
     - Negative kurtosis (or platykurtic) indicates that the distribution has lighter tails and a flatter peak than the normal distribution.
     - A kurtosis of zero (or mesokurtic) indicates that the distribution has tails and a peak that are similar to the normal distribution.
   - Kurtosis measures the concentration of data around the mean and provides insights into the presence of outliers in the distribution.


## 4. Measures of position: Percentiles, quartiles
A measure of position, in statistics, refers to a method or metric used to identify the location or relative position of individual data points within a dataset. These measures help to understand where specific values lie in relation to the entire distribution of data. They are essential for summarizing and interpreting the distribution of data.

1. **Percentiles:**
   - Percentiles are measures that divide a dataset into 100 equal parts, where each part represents a certain percentage of the data.
   - The k-th percentile is a value below which k percent of the observations fall. For example, the 50th percentile (also known as the median) is the value below which 50% of the data falls.
   - Percentiles help to understand the distribution of data and identify specific points within the data set.
   - Common percentiles include quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) and deciles (10th, 20th, ..., 90th percentiles).
2. **Quartiles:**
   - Quartiles are a special case of percentiles that divide a dataset into four equal parts.
   - There are three quartiles: 
     - The first quartile (Q1), also known as the lower quartile, is the value below which 25% of the data falls.
     - The second quartile (Q2), also known as the median, is the value below which 50% of the data falls.
     - The third quartile (Q3), also known as the upper quartile, is the value below which 75% of the data falls.
   - Quartiles are often used in box plots to visually represent the distribution of data, providing insights into the spread and central tendency of the dataset.

## 5. Graphical representations: Histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots
Graphical representations are visual tools used to illustrate data and convey information in a clear and concise manner. They provide a visual summary of the underlying data, making complex information easier to understand and interpret.

1. **Histograms:**
   - Histograms are graphical representations of the distribution of numerical data. 
   - They consist of bars that represent the frequency or count of data points falling within specific intervals (bins) of the data's range.
   - Histograms are useful for visualizing the shape, center, and spread of the data distribution.

2. **Bar Charts:**
   - Bar charts are graphical representations of categorical data.
   - They consist of bars of equal width but varying heights, where each bar represents the frequency, count, or proportion of data within a category.
   - Bar charts are useful for comparing the sizes or frequencies of different categories.

3. **Pie Charts:**
   - Pie charts are circular graphical representations used to display the relative proportions or percentages of different categories in a dataset.
   - Each "slice" of the pie represents a category, with its size proportional to the category's percentage of the whole.

4. **Box Plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots):**
   - Box plots are graphical representations of the distribution of numerical data.
   - They display the median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), and potential outliers in the data.
   - Box plots are useful for visualizing the spread, skewness, and presence of outliers in the data distribution.

5. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Scatter plots are graphical representations used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.
   - Each data point is represented by a marker, with its position determined by the values of the two variables.
   - Scatter plots are useful for identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between variables, such as correlation or clustering.

## Key Features of Descriptive Statistics (DESC)

**Description (D):** By analyzing the calculated statistics, you can describe the fundamental features of your data. This includes understanding the typical values (central tendency), how spread out the data is (variability), and the frequency of different values (distribution).

**Exploration (E):** Descriptive statistics play a crucial role in exploring data before building models. They help you understand the basic characteristics, central tendencies, and variations within your data, which is essential for choosing appropriate modeling techniques and avoiding potential biases.

**Summarization (S):** Ultimately, descriptive statistics give you concise summaries about the sample measures of your data. These summaries serve as a foundational understanding, guiding you towards further analysis and model building.

**Calculation (C):** Calculating descriptive statistics involves using various measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range to quantify different aspects of your data. These calculations provide numerical summaries that are easier to interpret compared to raw data.

* Single or Multiple variables



## Understanding Correlation

**Correlation:** This is a statistical measure that tells us how two things are **related** to each other. It doesn't tell us if one **causes** the other, just that they seem to change together in some way. 

**Example:** Imagine rain and umbrella use. They often occur together, but the rain doesn't **make** people use umbrellas. Correlation helps us see this connection, but not the reason behind it.

### Types of Correlation

1. **Positive Correlation:** This refers to a situation where two things **increase** together. For example, as the **engine size** of a car increases, the **price** of the car typically increases as well.

2. **Negative Correlation:** This describes a situation where one thing **increases** while the other **decreases**. For example, as the **fuel efficiency** (measured in miles per gallon) of a car increases, the **price** of the car typically decreases.

3. **Weak Correlation:** Some variables may exhibit weak or no correlation, rendering them ineffective predictors of each other's values, as seen with peak RPM and car price.


**Scatter Plot:** This is a visual representation of correlation. It shows data points as dots on a graph, and the **steeper** the line connecting these dots, the **stronger** the correlation between the two variables.
