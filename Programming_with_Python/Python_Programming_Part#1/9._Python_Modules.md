# Python Modules

## What is a Python Module?

A Python module is a file containing Python code, typically with functions, classes, and variables, that can be reused in other Python scripts or modules. Modules provide a way to organize code and make it more modular, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

## Value and Purpose of Modules

Modules follow modular programming, breaking code functionality into parts for advantages such as scoping, reusability, and simplicity.

- **Scoping:** Modules create separate namespaces, preventing conflicts between functions with the same name in different modules.
  
- **Reusability:** Modules promote code reusability, avoiding duplication and making code more memory-efficient.

- **Simplicity:** Modularization helps achieve simplicity by minimizing interdependency between modules, each serving a specific purpose.

## Importing and Executing Modules

- Modules are imported only once during execution.
  
- Code inside modules is executed the first time the module is imported, even if imported multiple times.

- Stand-alone modules are defined at the beginning of the code, and functions inside must be executed for their utility.

- Code execution in Python is serial, requiring module import before function execution.

## Accessing Modules in Python: Efficiency and Convenience
Accessing modules, whether built-in or user-defined, enhances efficiency and convenience. Built-in modules act like pre-packaged building materials, allowing you to assemble code without searching for individual components.

## Types of Modules

- **Built-in Modules:** These are part of the standard Python library, providing ready-to-use functionalities.

- **User-Defined Modules:** Any Python file can serve as a module, created by users for specific functionalities.

## Module Search Sequence

The interpreter searches for modules in the following sequence:

1. Current directory path.
2. Built-in module directory.
3. Python path environment variable with a list of directories.
4. Installation-dependent default directory.

## Demonstrating Module Access

Let's explore accessing modules through a demonstration:

```python
 # Example: Accessing Built-in Modules
import os  # Importing the 'os' module

 # Retrieve module search locations
locations = os.sys.path

 # Print each location
for loc in locations:
    print(loc)

 # Importing a module in the middle of the code
import calendar  # Importing the 'calendar' module

 # Using functions from the 'calendar' module
leap_days = calendar.leapdays(2000, 2050)
print(f"Leap days between 2000 and 2050: {leap_days}")

is_leap = calendar.isleap(2036)
print(f"Is 2036 a leap year? {is_leap}")
```

## Tips for Better Code

- Import required modules at the beginning of your code for clarity.

- Explore modules using hover functionality (e.g., press command or control key) to view their content.

- Understand module locations listed in the terminal for effective use.


## Namespaces
A namespace in Python is a mapping from names (such as variable names, function names, and class names) to corresponding objects. It serves as a container for holding and organizing identifiers to avoid naming conflicts.

## Scopes
A scope refers to the region in a program where a namespace is directly accessible. Understanding scopes is essential for determining where a variable or name is valid and can be accessed.

## Four Types of Scopes

1. **Local Scope:** Inside a function, variable search starts here.
2. **Enclosed Scope:** Defined within enclosing or nested functions.
3. **Global Scope:** Defined outside functions, at the top level.
4. **Built-in Scope:** Keywords present in the built-in module.

## LEGB Rule for Scope Resolution

Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in - the order in which Python searches for a variable.

### Example:

```python
alpha = 10  # Global variable

def b():
    beta = 20  # Local variable
    def c():
        gamma = 30  # Enclosed variable
        print(f"Global: {id(alpha)}, \nLocal: {id(beta)}, \nEnclosed: {id(gamma)}")

    c()

b()
```

## Implicit Variable Declaration

Variables are implicitly declared, local unless stated otherwise. No explicit datatype declaration is needed.

## Global Variables and Best Practices

Global variables are discouraged in production code due to potential complexities. They can lead to "spaghetti code."

## Changing Variable Scope

Use `global` to access global variables within a function. Use `nonlocal` for nested functions, but it must be defined earlier in the enclosing function.

### Example:

```python
def d():
    animal = "camel"  # Global variable

    def e():
        nonlocal animal
        animal = "elephant"  # Local variable
        print(f"Inside nested function: {animal}")

    e()
    print(f"After nested function: {animal}")

animal = "giraffe"  # Global variable
d()
print(f"Global variable after function call: {animal}")
```

### Output:
```
Inside nested function: elephant
After nested function: elephant
Global variable after function call: giraffe
```

### Note on Nonlocal Keyword

If the `nonlocal` declaration is missing, attempting to modify a nonlocal variable will result in an error.
