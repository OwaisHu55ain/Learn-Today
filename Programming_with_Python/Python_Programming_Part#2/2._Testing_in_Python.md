## Overview of Pytest for Unit Testing in Python

**1. File Creation:**
   - Create a file named `addition.py` with functions for addition and subtraction.

   ```python
   # addition.py
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b

   def sub(a, b):
       return a - b
   ```

**2. Test File Setup:**
   - Create a test file named `test_addition.py` to write test cases.
   - Import the functions to be tested and the `pytest` module.

   ```python
   # test_addition.py
   from addition import add, sub
   import pytest
   ```

**3. Writing Test Cases:**
   - Define test cases using the naming convention `test_<function_name>`.
   - Utilize the `assert` keyword to check conditions and validate expected results.

   ```python
   def test_add():
       assert add(4, 5) == 9

   def test_sub():
       assert sub(4, 5) == -1
   ```

**4. Running Tests:**
   - Run tests using the `pytest` command in the terminal.

   ```bash
   python -m pytest test_addition.py
   ```

**5. Test Results:**
   - Dots indicate passed tests; 'f' indicates a failed test.
   - Easily identify the location and reason for test failures.

**6. Assertion Techniques:**
   - Use various operators (equality, inequality) or keywords (is, in) in assertions.
   - Multiple assertions within a test function ensure comprehensive testing.

   ```python
   def test_multiple_assertions():
       assert add(4, 5) == 9
       assert sub(4, 5) == -1
       assert True  # Additional assertions
   ```

**7. Running Specific Tests:**
   - Run tests for a specific function using the `pytest` command with the function name.

   ```bash
   python -m pytest test_addition.py::test_add
   ```

**8. Test Failures:**
   - intentionally modify a test to fail and observe the failure message.
   - Note the change in dots to indicate failed tests.

   ```python
   def test_sub():
       assert sub(4, 5) == -2  # Intentional failure
   ```

**9. Pass without Assert:**
   - A test can pass without assertions if only `pass` is used.

   ```python
   def test_pass_without_assert():
       pass
   ```

**10. Good Practice:**
   - Follow the `test_<function_name>` naming convention for both file and function names.
   - Consistent naming enhances readability and organization.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**1. Introduction to TDD:**
   - Testing's significance in software development has grown, addressing bugs and ensuring software reliability.
   - TDD, a modern approach, involves writing tests before code, fostering a proactive testing methodology.

**2. TDD Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Write a test for a feature that intentionally fails.
   - **Step 2:** Write code to make the test pass.
   - **Step 3:** Run the test, expecting failure.
   - **Step 4:** Evaluate errors and refactor the code.
   - **Step 5:** Rerun the process, known as the red-green-refactor cycle.

   ```python
   # Example Test in TDD
   def test_addition():
       assert add(4, 5) == 9
   ```

**3. Benefits of TDD:**
   - Ensures comprehensive test coverage by writing tests before coding.
   - Clarity in feature expectations from the beginning.
   - Facilitates component integration and forecasting for future changes.
   - Develops competence in refactoring and promotes smaller, bug-resistant code.

**4. Using Pytest in TDD:**
   - Pytest simplifies TDD with its focus on functions instead of classes, making it more accessible.
  
   ```python
   # Using Pytest for TDD
   def test_addition():
       assert add(4, 5) == 9
   ```

**5. Differences with Traditional Testing:**
   - TDD emphasizes highlighting requirements and standards early in the development process.
   - Modern development often combines TDD and traditional testing based on project needs.

**6. TDD Subtypes:**
   - Various TDD subtypes cater to different aspects of software development:
     - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
     - Acceptance Test-Driven Development
     - Scaling Test-Driven Development
     - Developer Test-Driven Development

**7. Growing Acceptance:**
   - Smaller code, early bug detection, enhanced code extensibility, and simplified debugging contribute to TDD's increasing acceptance.



## Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Code Example

**1. TDD Methodology:**
   - TDD reverses the conventional testing process, emphasizing writing tests before writing code.

**2. TDD Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Write a test for a feature that intentionally fails.
   - **Step 2:** Write code to make the test pass.
   - **Step 3:** Run the test, expecting failure.
   - **Step 4:** Evaluate errors and refactor the code.
   - **Step 5:** Rerun the process, known as the red-green-refactor cycle.

**3. Example Scenario - Student Enrollment:**
   - Demonstration using a test case for checking student enrollments against a predefined list of names.

**4. Test Setup:**
   - Two files created: `test_findstring.py` (testing file) and `findstring.py` (main file).
   - Pytest package installed for TDD.

**5. Writing Test Functions:**
   - Test function named `test_ispresent` to check the `ispresent` function.
   - Import necessary modules (`curses`, `pytest`) and the main file (`findstring`).
   - Use the `assert` statement to validate the functionality of the `ispresent` function.

   ```python
   # Example Test Function
   def test_ispresent():
       assert ispresent("Al") == True
   ```

**6. Writing Main Code:**
   - Create the `findstring.py` file with the `ispresent` function.
   - Define the `ispresent` function, checking if the provided name is present in a list.

   ```python
   # Main Code
   def ispresent(person):
       names_list = ["Al", "Bob", "Charlie"]
       return person in names_list
   ```

**7. Testing and Refactoring:**
   - Run the test to validate the code. The test passes because "Al" is in the list.
   - Address data integrity concerns by adding another test function, e.g., `test_nodigit`.

   ```python
   # Additional Test Function
   def test_nodigit():
       assert no_digit("N7") == False
   ```

   - Update the main code to include the `no_digit` function, which fails one of the tests due to a numeric character.

   ```python
   # Additional Main Code
   def no_digit(person):
       return not any(char.isdigit() for char in person)
   ```

**8. Iterative Testing and Refinement:**
   - Continue the TDD cycle by adding more test cases and modifying the code until all tests pass.

**9. Conclusion:**
   - TDD fosters a cyclical approach of writing tests, coding, and refining until all tests pass, ensuring robust functionality.
