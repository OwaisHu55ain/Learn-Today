# Object Oriented Programming

## What is an Object in Python?
An object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a class. A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

Here are some key points about objects in Python:

1. **Instance of a Class:**
   - An object is an instance of a class. It is created based on the structure defined by the class.
   - Objects can be thought of as containers that encapsulate data (attributes) and the functions that operate on that data (methods).

2. **Attributes and Methods:**
   - Objects have attributes, which are variables that store data, and methods, which are functions that perform actions associated with the object.
   - Attributes and methods are accessed using dot notation, e.g., `object.attribute` or `object.method()`.

3. **Dynamic Nature:**
   - Python objects are dynamic, meaning attributes and methods can be added, modified, or removed during runtime.

4. **Identity, Type, and Value:**
   - Each object in Python has a unique identity (address in memory), a type that defines its class, and a value that represents its actual data.

5. **Creation of Objects:**
   - Objects are created by calling the constructor method (`__init__`) of a class. The constructor initializes the object's attributes.

Here's a simple example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

 # Creating objects (instances) of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

 # Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
dog2.bark()        # Output: Max says Woof!

```


## What is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Classes mainly perform two kind of operations, attribute references and instantiation.



**Attributes:** Refer to a variable declared in a class.

**Behavior:** Associated with the method in a class.


## Instantiation Process
Instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class, which is an object that is a member of that class. This process involves three key steps:
1. Class Definition
2. Creating New Instance
3. Initializing New Instance

## Special Methods
Special methods, often referred to as "magic methods" or "dunder methods" (short for "double underscore"), in Python are methods with names enclosed by double underscores at both ends, like `__method__`. These methods have special significance in the language, and they are automatically invoked by the interpreter in specific situations.

Here are some common special methods and their purposes:

1. `__init__(self, ...)`: The constructor method, called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.

2. `__str__(self)`: Invoked by the `str()` built-in function and the `print()` function to obtain a string representation of an object.

3. `__repr__(self)`: Used by the built-in `repr()` function to obtain a string representation for debugging purposes. It should ideally return a string that, when passed to `eval()`, would recreate the object.

4. `__len__(self)`: Invoked by the `len()` built-in function to obtain the length of an object.

5. `__add__(self, other)`: Invoked when the `+` operator is used with objects. It allows you to define the behavior of the addition operation for instances of your class.

6. `__sub__(self, other)`: Invoked when the `-` operator is used with objects. It allows you to define the behavior of the subtraction operation.

7. `__mul__(self, other)`: Invoked when the `*` operator is used with objects. It allows you to define the behavior of the multiplication operation.

8. `__truediv__(self, other)`: Invoked when the `/` operator is used with objects. It allows you to define the behavior of the division operation.

These methods provide a way for you to define how instances of your class behave in certain situations, making your classes more intuitive and flexible. By implementing these methods, you can customize the behavior of your objects in response to various operations and functions.

```
 # Use of Magic Method

class Fraction:
    # Constructor to initialize the fraction with numerator (n) and denominator (d)
    def __init__(self, n, d):
        self.num = n
        self.den = d

    # String representation of the fraction
    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.num}/{self.den}'

    # Addition operation for fractions
    def __add__(self, other):
        # Calculate numerator and denominator for the sum
        temp_num = self.num * other.den + other.num * self.den
        temp_den = self.den * other.den

        # Return the result as a formatted string
        return f"{temp_num}/{temp_den}"

    # Subtraction operation for fractions
    def __sub__(self, other):
        # Calculate numerator and denominator for the difference
        temp_num = self.num * other.den - other.num * self.den
        temp_den = self.den * other.den

        # Return the result as a formatted string
        return f"{temp_num}/{temp_den}"

    # Multiplication operation for fractions
    def __mul__(self, other):
        # Calculate numerator and denominator for the product
        temp_num = self.num * other.num
        temp_den = self.den * other.den

        # Return the result as a formatted string
        return f"{temp_num}/{temp_den}"

    # Division operation for fractions
    def __truediv__(self, other):
        # Calculate numerator and denominator for the quotient
        temp_num = self.num * other.den
        temp_den = self.den * other.num

        # Return the result as a formatted string
        return f"{temp_num}/{temp_den}"

 # Create two Fraction objects
x = Fraction(3, 4)
y = Fraction(5, 6)

 # Print the string representation of each fraction
print(x)
print(y)

 # Perform arithmetic operations on fractions and print the results
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # Division

```
## Name Mangling
Name mangling is a technique used in Python to make the names of attributes in a class more unique by adding a prefix to them. This is primarily done to avoid naming conflicts in the case of inheritance. The convention is to add a double underscore (`__`) as a prefix to the attribute name.

Here's a brief overview of how name mangling works:

1. **Original Name**: The original name of the attribute is prefixed with a double underscore when defining it in the class.

2. **Name Transformation**: The Python interpreter internally transforms the name by adding the class name as a prefix and an additional underscore.

3. **Accessing the Mangled Name**: The mangled name can still be accessed from outside the class by combining the class name and the mangled attribute name.

Here's an example to illustrate name mangling:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        # Name mangling for the attribute 'my_attribute'
        self.__my_attribute = 42

 # Creating an instance of the class
obj = MyClass()

 # Accessing the mangled attribute from outside the class
 # The mangled name becomes _MyClass__my_attribute
print(obj._MyClass__my_attribute)  # Output: 42
```


## Benefits of OOP:
1. Modularity
2. Reusability
3. Productivity
4. Easily upgradable and scalable
5. Interface description
6. Security
7. Flexibility

**Key component of OOP**
1. Classes 
2. Objects
3. Methods

**Classes**
A class in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions).

**Object**
An object in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a self-contained unit of code that contains data and behavior. Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP, and they are used to model real-world objects and concepts.



**Methods**
A function that is associated with the class. Methods define the behavior of objects that are created from the class.

```
 # Simple Example of class
 # class definition

class car:
    #pass is a place holder statement that does nothing
    pass
 # creating objects of the car class
car1 = car()
car2 = car()

 # assigning attributes of the car class
car1.windows=4
car1.tyres=4
car1.engine="diesel"

 # Assigning attributes of the car class
car2.windows=6
car2.tyres=6
car2.engine="petrol"

 # Accessing and printing the engine attribute
print(car1.engine)
print(car2.engine)
```
```
 #Example No. 2

 # Definition of the Car class with constructor (__init__ method)
class Car:
    # Constructor (__init__ method) to initialize object attributes
    def __init__(self, no, windows, tyres, engine):
        self.no = no             # Assigning 'no' parameter to the object's 'no' attribute
        self.windows = windows   # Assigning 'windows' parameter to the object's 'windows' attribute
        self.tyres = tyres       # Assigning 'tyres' parameter to the object's 'tyres' attribute
        self.engine = engine     # Assigning 'engine' parameter to the object's 'engine' attribute

    # Method to print a message about the car engine type
    def self_driving(self):
        print("The car no. {} has {} windows and {} tyres and this car type is {}".format(self.no, self.windows, self.tyres, self.engine))

 # Creating objects of the Car class with specific values for attributes
car1 = Car(1, 4, 6, "electric")  # Creates the first car object
car2 = Car(2, 4, 4, "petrol")    # Creates the second car object

 # Calling the self_driving method for car1 object
car1.self_driving()
 # Output: The car no. 1 has 4 windows and 6 tyres and this car type is electric

 # Calling the self_driving method for car2 object
car2.self_driving()
 # Output: The car no. 2 has 4 windows and 4 tyres and this car type is petrol
```

**Constructor**
A constructor is a special method in a class used to create and initialize objects of that class. It is named “__init__” and is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created. There are two main types of constructors.
1. Parameterize Constructor
2. Default Constructor

1. **Parameterize Constructor**: A parameterize constructor is a constructor with parameters. It allows you to pass values to initialize the object’s attributes when the object is created.
```
 # Example

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.attribute1 = param1
        self.attribute2 = param2

obj = MyClass(10, "Hello")
```
2. **Default Constructor** A default constructor is a constructor without any parameters. It does not take any explicit values during object creation. 
```
 # Example

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.attribute1 = 0  # Default value for attribute1
        self.attribute2 = ""  # Default value for attribute2

obj = MyClass()  # Creating an object using the default constructor
```

**self**
The self parameter in the constructor represents the instance of the class (i.e., the object being created) and is automatically passed to the constructor when creating an object.


## Fundamental Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
The four main concepts of OOP are as following:

1. **Encapsulation:**
It describes the idea of restricting access to methods and attributes in a class. This will hide the complex details from the users, and prevent data being modified by accident. In Python, this is achieved by using private methods or attributes using underscore as prefix, i.e. single “_” or double “__”.
```
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):
        # Constructor to initialize the Student object with name, age, and marks.
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        # Using double underscores for private variable 'marks'.
        self.__marks = marks

    def get_marks(self):
        # Getter method to retrieve the marks.
        return f"{self.name}'s Marks: {self.__marks}"

    def set_marks(self, marks):
        # Setter method to update the marks.
        self.__marks = marks

 # Creating a Student object with the name Maria, age 25, and initial marks 75.
Student1 = Student("Maria", 25, 75)

 # Accessing public attributes directly.
print(Student1.age)  # Output: 25
print(Student1.name)  # Output: Maria

 # Using the get_marks method to access private attribute '__marks'.
print(Student1.get_marks())  # Output: Maria's Marks: 75

 # Using the set_marks method to update the private attribute '__marks'.
Student1.set_marks(55)

 # Checking the updated marks using the get_marks method.
print(Student1.get_marks())  # Output: Maria's Marks: 55
```

2. **Inheritance:**
Binding the data with the code that manipulates it. It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference
```
 # Define the Teacher class
class Teacher:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize teachers' names for different subjects
        self.math = "John"
        self.science = "Jackob"
        self.history = "Ben"
        self.biology = "Given"


 # Define the Student class, inheriting from the Teacher class
class Student(Teacher):
    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):
        # Call the constructor of the parent class (Teacher)
        super().__init__()
        
        # Initialize student-specific attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__marks = marks

    def math_teacher(self):
        # Access the math teacher's name from the inherited attribute
        return f"{self.name} studies math from {self.math}"

    def science_teacher(self):
        # Access the science teacher's name from the inherited attribute
        return f"{self.name} studies science from {self.science}"

    def history_teacher(self):
        # Access the history teacher's name from the inherited attribute
        return f"{self.name} studies history from {self.history}"

    def biology_teacher(self):
        # Access the biology teacher's name from the inherited attribute
        return f"{self.name} studies biology from {self.biology}"

    def get_marks(self):
        # Get and return the student's marks
        return f"{self.name}'s Marks: {self.__marks}"

    def set_marks(self, marks):
        # Set the student's marks
        self.__marks = marks


 # Create a Student object
Student1 = Student("Maria", 25, 75)

 # Access and print information using the added methods
print(Student1.age)  # Print the student's age
print(Student1.name)  # Print the student's name

print(Student1.get_marks())  # Print the initial marks of the student
Student1.set_marks(55)  # Set new marks for the student

print(Student1.get_marks())  # Print the updated marks of the student
print(Student1.math_teacher())  # Print information about the math teacher
print(Student1.science_teacher())  # Print information about the science teacher
print(Student1.history_teacher())  # Print information about the history teacher
print(Student1.biology_teacher())  # Print information about the biology teacher

```




3. **Polymorphism:**
Polymorphism means to process objects differently based on their data type. In other words it means, one method with multiple implementation, for a certain class of action. And which implementation to be used is decided at runtime depending upon the situation (i.e., data type of the object)

4. **Abstraction:**
Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user. For example, when you login to your Amazon account online, you enter your user_id and password and press login, what happens when you press login, how the input data sent to amazon server, how it gets verified is all abstracted away from the you.
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Caffe(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        # Default ingredients for tea and coffee
        self.milk = "Milk Pak"
        self.water = "Nestle"
        self.tea_leaves = "Lipton"
        self.sugar = "Brown"
        self.coffee = "Nescafe"

    @abstractmethod
    def karak_cha(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def mocha(self):
        pass

class Hotel(Caffe):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Additional items offered by the hotel
        self.biryani1 = "Karachi Biryani"
        self.biryani2 = "Delhi Biryani"
        self.pulao1 = "Kabli pulao"

    def karak_cha(self):
        print("""Tea Making (By Caffe)
Step 1: Add half cup of {} Water.
Step 2: Add two tea spoons of {} Tea.
Step 3: Add one spoon of {} Sugar.
Step 4: Boil for five minutes on high flame.
Step 5: After five minutes, add half cup of {} Milk.
Step 6: Boil for 2 minutes and then serve into the cup.""".format(
            self.water, self.tea_leaves, self.sugar, self.milk))

    def mocha(self):
        print("""Coffee Making (By Caffe)
Step 1: Add half cup of {} Water.
Step 2: Add two tea spoons of {} Coffee.
Step 3: Add one spoon of {} Sugar.
Step 4: Boil for five minutes on high flame.
Step 5: After five minutes, add half cup of {} Milk.
Step 6: Boil for 2 minutes and then serve into the cup.""".format(
            self.water, self.coffee, self.sugar, self.milk))

 # Create an instance of the Hotel class
hotel1 = Hotel()

 # Call the tea and coffee preparation methods
hotel1.karak_cha()
print("\n")  # Add a newline for better separation
hotel1.mocha()
```
## Types of Inheritance
There are several types of inheritance, which allow one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The main types of inheritance in Python are:

1. **Single Inheritance:**
   - In single inheritance, a class can inherit from only one base class. It is the simplest form of inheritance.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Parent:
         pass

     class Child(Parent):
         pass
     ```

2. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one base class. This allows the derived class to inherit properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Parent1:
         pass

     class Parent2:
         pass

     class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
         pass
     ```

3. **Multilevel Inheritance:**
   - In multilevel inheritance, a class can inherit from another class, and then another class can inherit from the derived class, creating a chain or hierarchy of classes.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Grandparent:
         pass

     class Parent(Grandparent):
         pass

     class Child(Parent):
         pass
     ```

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:**
   - In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from a single base or parent class. Each child class represents a specialization or modification of the base class.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         pass

     class Mammal(Animal):
         pass

     class Bird(Animal):
         pass
     ```

5. **Hybrid Inheritance:**
   - Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It might involve a mix of single, multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical inheritance.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class A:
         pass

     class B(A):
         pass

     class C(A):
         pass

     class D(B, C):
         pass
     ```


## Getter and Setter Methods
A getter and setter are methods or functions used to access and modify the private attributes (variables) of a class, providing a way to control the access to the class's data.

1. **Getter:**
   - **Definition:** A getter, also known as an accessor or getter method, is a method used to retrieve the value of a private attribute from a class.
   - **Purpose:** Getters allow controlled access to the private attributes of a class by providing a way to retrieve their values. They often have names like `get_attribute()`.

   
   ```python
   class MyClass:
       def __init__(self):
           self.__my_attribute = 42

       def get_my_attribute(self):
           return self.__my_attribute

   obj = MyClass()
   value = obj.get_my_attribute()
   print(value)  # Output: 42
   ```

2. **Setter:**
   - **Definition:** A setter, also known as a mutator or setter method, is a method used to modify the value of a private attribute in a class.
   - **Purpose:** Setters allow controlled modification of the private attributes of a class by providing a way to update their values. They often have names like `set_attribute(new_value)`.

   
   ```python
   class MyClass:
       def __init__(self):
           self.__my_attribute = 42

       def set_my_attribute(self, new_value):
           self.__my_attribute = new_value

   obj = MyClass()
   obj.set_my_attribute(100)
   print(obj.get_my_attribute())  # Output: 100
   ```
